# GradientDescentAdvertising
Implementation of a gradient descent algorithm designed for optimizing advertising sales using Facebook data.

## Abstract

This research paper focuses on the application of the gradient descent algorithm to optimize advertising sales for a company using Facebook data. The objective is to improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns by leveraging data-driven insights. The methodology involves performing a method for estimating the coefficients, and optimization algorithm on multiple linear regression, and evaluating the performance of the model each time using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared R^2 metrics. A dataset from Kaggle datasets containing 1,143 rows and 11 columns was utilized for the analysis. The findings indicate that the gradient descent algorithm, in conjunction with multi-linear regression, demonstrates favorable results in optimizing advertising sales. The model achieved a fair appropriate estimation in MSE and an increase in R^2, indicating accuracy and predictive power. These findings suggest the potential of utilizing Facebook data and gradient descent algorithms for effective advertising strategies.
